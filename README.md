# Event Pass Manager - Smart Contract

## Overview

The **Event Pass Manager** smart contract provides a secure and efficient way to manage digital event passes. It enables the creation, transfer, revocation, and validation of event passes, all backed by a secure ownership and access control system. This contract utilizes Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to represent the event passes, offering a decentralized and immutable solution for event organizers and participants.

Key features include:
- **Role-based access control**: Only authorized administrators can perform sensitive operations like issuing or revoking passes.
- **Single and bulk pass issuance**: Supports both individual and bulk issuance of passes, with metadata associated with each pass.
- **Pass revocation and reassignments**: Allows passes to be revoked or reassigned to new owners, ensuring flexibility in pass management.
- **Comprehensive pass verification**: Verifies pass validity, ownership, and revocation status, with detailed querying capabilities.

## Features

- **Pass Creation**: Single or bulk issuance of event passes with associated metadata.
- **Pass Management**: Revoke or transfer passes, ensuring valid ownership.
- **Pass Queries**: Retrieve pass details, status, history, and ownership verification.
- **Administrative Control**: Only the contract owner can perform administrative actions like issuing, revoking, and transferring passes.
- **Pass Security**: Ensures pass authenticity and checks for revoked or non-transferable passes.

## Core Operations

### Issuing Passes
- `create-pass`: Issues a single event pass.
- `create-multiple-passes`: Issues multiple event passes in bulk (up to 50 passes per operation).

### Pass Management
- `revoke-pass`: Invalidates a previously issued pass.
- `reassign-pass`: Transfers pass ownership to a different user.
- `return-to-issuer`: Returns a pass to the original issuer.
- `restore-pass`: Reactivates a previously revoked pass.

### Queries
- `get-pass-details`: Retrieves detailed information for a specific pass.
- `check-pass-validity`: Verifies if a pass is valid and active.
- `get-issued-pass-count`: Returns the total number of passes issued.
- `verify-pass-authenticity`: Confirms the authenticity of a pass.

## Requirements

- **Blockchain Platform**: This contract is designed to run on the Stacks blockchain, utilizing Clarity smart contracts.
- **NFT Standards**: The contract uses NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) to represent and manage event passes.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<username>/event-pass-manager.git
    ```

2. Deploy the contract to the Stacks blockchain using the Clarity environment.

## Contract Interaction

- Deploy and interact with the contract through a wallet or using smart contract tools available for the Stacks blockchain.
- The contract owner (deployer) has administrative control over all functions related to pass issuance, revocation, and management.

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Issuing a Single Pass
```clarity
(create-pass "VIP Access for Event A")
```

### 2. Issuing Multiple Passes in Bulk
```clarity
(create-multiple-passes ["VIP Access for Event A" "General Access for Event B" "Early Bird Access for Event C"])
```

### 3. Revoking a Pass
```clarity
(revoke-pass 1)  ;; Revokes pass with ID 1
```

### 4. Reassigning Pass Ownership
```clarity
(reassign-pass 1 "user1-address" "user2-address")
```

### 5. Querying Pass Status
```clarity
(get-pass-status 1)  ;; Checks if pass ID 1 is revoked or active
```
